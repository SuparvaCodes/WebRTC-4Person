# WebRTC-4Person

### This is an simple but complex which uses WebRTC to create video calls between multiple persons instead of two's. The RTCHandler.js allows it to handle multiple connections.



# Managing backends

### The backend of the project is handled by an SQL Server and NodeJS server. Here I used NodeJS for RTC signalling and SQL Server to manage records of users in rooms and allow stability.
